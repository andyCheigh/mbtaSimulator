Threads & Locks Explanation:
First, I'm making new threads for each passenger. Since passengers' behaviors
are independent of each other, it makes sense to have separate threads. For
each passenger, I run a while loop until each of them has arrived at their
destination.

Then, I'm making new threads for each train. Since trains run independently
unless a station already has another train, it makes sense to have separate
threads. In order to solve more-than-one-train-in-a-station problem, I attempted
to use 'synchronized' so that the the train waits until the next station's train
has left. But since this was not working, I had to comment the code out.

At the end, I joined all the train threads together as they will be happening
concurrently.
